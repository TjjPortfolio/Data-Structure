# Data-Structure

The project was to develop a simple invoicing system for a used dealership of xx.com. This project is to consider reading vehicle information from the data file carlist.csv, which includes vehicle name, price, registration date, mileage, fuel type, transmission, engine size, number of doors, color, URL, and date of sale. The developers considered that customer information is also very important, so additional customer names, ages, gender, and status were added to the data file. The main roles that use the system are staff, salesperson, and manager.

The system makes different restrictions on the functions of each role. Staff members can only operate the system to log in and out, search for vehicles, create bills, and create invoices. Salespersons can add booking vehicles and managing customers to the functions available to staff members. The manager can operate the system with the same functions as the staff and salesperson, adding the ability to generate invoice reports. Finally, the assignment had to implement the solution algorithm using C++ programming language with appropriate data structures.
